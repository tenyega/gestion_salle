    // this is generally to redirect the website to the index.php of the public folder which will do the necessary to do the routing of the routes in symfony 
    //Inside the public folder, this .htaccess file will manage Symfony’s URL rewriting, handle PHP settings, set up custom error pages, and set up caching for assets.

-  connect to SSH using terminus /git bash 
	and go to file public_html 	and launch 
		php -r "copy('https://getcomposer.org/installer', 'composer-setup.php');"
		php -r "if (hash_file('sha384', 'composer-setup.php') === 'dac665fdc30fdd8ec78b38b9800061b4150413ff2e3b6f88543c636f7cd84f6db9189d43a81e5503cda447da73c7e5b6') { echo 'Installer verified'; } else { echo 'Installer corrupt'; unlink('composer-setup.php'); } echo PHP_EOL;"
		php composer-setup.php
		php -r "unlink('composer-setup.php');"

- php bin/console cache:clear --env=dev
 cleared the cache as the website was always in dev mode for the moment 

-added  this code to display the error at the PHP level which was not visible earlier with the incapatibility of the php versions 
    php_value display_errors 1
    php_value display_startup_errors 1

- with the code above i got to know that i didnt do the do the installation of it dependencies which en error of the autoloading when i went to the site hall4all.fr( vendor was missing)

- installation of all the dependencies via git bash ( connecting using ssh)
    php composer.phar install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader

-  but with the commande above i used to have a problem of the debug_bunddle so i change the .env file with app_env= prod

Bingo the website worked but the images of the logo was not visible  yet at this point 

-To be able to see the images the img folder should be inside the public folder not in assets so i just moved the img folder to the public and it worked
